## How to Contribute?

### Raising an issue:
For now and till the intial development of the app the mentor will be creating the issues for the participants to work on. But as this is an Open Source project and we would be happy to see contributors who report bugs and file feature requests submitting pull requests in the later stage of the app development as well.
 
### Sending pull requests:

- ####  You can either use Android Studio in-built Version Control System.

- ####  Or you can use the basic git-bash commands to work.
