## For first time Contributors

First time contributors can read [CONTRIBUTING.md](/CONTRIBUTING.md) file for help regarding creating issues and sending pull requests.

## Branch Policy

* **development** All development goes on in this branch. If you're making a contribution, you are supposed to make a pull request to _development_.
* **master** This contains main working code. After significant features/bugfixes are accumulated on development, we make an update to the master branch for release.

Therefore it is requested and expected from all of you to make contribution to ____development branch____ for now and then before the final release of the app we will make it apply in the master branch.

## Code practices

Please help us follow the best practices to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

 * Single commit per pull request
 * For writing commit messages please read the COMMITSTYLE carefully. Kindly adhere to the guidelines.
 * Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
 * The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them by themsleves.
 * If the PR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description by following the pull request template.

## Join the development

* Before you join development, please set up the project on your local machine, run it and go through the application completely. 
* All the issues are based on first come first serve basis.
* If you would like to work on an issue, drop in a comment at the issue. If it is already assigned to someone, but there is no sign of any work being done, please free to drop in a comment so that the issue can be assigned to you if the previous assignee has dropped it entirely.
